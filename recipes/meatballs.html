    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This is my take on(see: to the best of my memory) the way I learned to make meatballs. It's a simple recipe, but most great things are. I suppose I'm a bit fond of these because that restaurant holds some "interesting" memories...</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground veal don't cheap out... please</li>
        <li>1 lb ground medium beef</li>
        <li>1 lb ground pork</li>
        <li>a chunk of parm about half the size of your fist(grated)(the real stuff, dont dare use anything else)</li>
        <li>1 bunch of italian parsley(chiffonade), I mean did you think you'd use anything else?</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk... please not skim!</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic (grated), don't you dare use that shit in a jar</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients and add salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Take mixture and make into 2-3" meatballs</li>
