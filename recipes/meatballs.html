    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This is my take on(see: to the best of my memory) the way I learned to make meatballs. It's a simple recipe, but most great things are. I suppose I'm a bit fond of these because that restaurant holds some "interesting" memories...</p>

        <li>ground veal don't cheap out... please</li>
        <li>ground medium beef</li>
        <li>ground pork</li>
        <li>a chunk of parm(the real stuff, dont dare use anything else)</li>
        <li>italian parsley, I mean did you think you'd use anything else?</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
